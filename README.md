## Hello there :D

My name is Tomas Lisazo, a young Computer Science student at UBA.

I like to develop video games in my free time, apart from programming different programs to learn and get to know different tools. The different programming projects that I design are published in this account.

## ðŸŽ® Published games:

- [Spinning Ball](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=t0m45DEV.SpinningBall)
- [The Top](https://cachimba-games.itch.io/the-top)
- [Santa's drunk](https://cachimba-games.itch.io/santas-drunk)
- [Through the Asteroid Belt](https://t0m45dev.itch.io/asteroidsbelt)

I am currently working on a mobile video game that, hopefully, will be published before 2025 âš¡
